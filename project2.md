## Project description

This projects contains two different implementations of a balanced binary search tree data structure. The purpose of the project was to experiment with different techniques of this task, and how the differ in efficiency. This project choose to focus on the AVL tree and Splay tree implementations in particular. This is a full scale implementation, with the ability to add to, delete, find the height of the tree and etc. For in depth examination of the differences read Implementation Differnces.txt. This program does not output anything into the terminal, but there is a timing program inlcuded to track the speed of actions on the data structures. However, you would need to pipe the results into a plotting program (such as gnuplot, that was used for the figure below).

## How to compiles / run the programs

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

Shell Program:
```bash
1) Go into any normal linux terminal and cd into the directory with the file
2) Give permissions chmod 755 lab02.sh
3) Then run it with ./lab02.sh
4) Requires a file named words.txt, but can be filed with anything the user wants in terms of content (1 word per line).
```

## Image Examples

Below are screenshots taken from the three programs. They do not show source code, but do show the output/results of all programs. Considering there is no input for the programs there is notable UI elements to document. The Perl examples are screenshots of the files created, and the rest are derived from the terminal. Refer to the README.md file for any questions about the functionality of each program.

## 3. Additional Considerations

This is a compilation of programs that come together to form a larger project. Its much easier to utilize online compilers with how many languages the project switches between. That being said the Shell program's text file that holds sample words is to big for most online compilers. In that case, as mentioned in instuctions, you would have to utilize a linux machine to run the shell program. Alternatively, you can simply provide your own words.txt to run from.
